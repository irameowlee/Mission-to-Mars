# Mission to Mars
Robin wants to gather data about mars anddisplay it in a central location. We want to build an application that scrapes data whenever we command it to do so. 

## Overview
- Used webscraping methods to extract data
- Chrome developer tools to identify HTML components
- Beautiful Soup and splinter to automate the scrape
- Mongo DB, an SQL database, to store the data
- Flask to display

## Results
- Was able to gain data from different sources quickly instead of visiting multiple websites and manually gathering data.
